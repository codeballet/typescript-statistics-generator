# Statistics Generator

The Statistics Generator app serves to exemplify a project built using the principles of "composition" and "delegation", as the terms are used by Erich Gamma in his book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" (1995). The use of the term composition stands in contrast to the design principle of "inheritance". As above, the word inheritance is used according to the definition by Gamma.

The app is coded in TypeScript.

## Run the app

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `npm i`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. By default, a new file entitled `report.html` will be written in the app's root directory.

The output of the `report.html` is:

```
<div>
  <h1>Analysis Output</h1>
  <div>Team Man United won 18 games</div>
</div>
```
